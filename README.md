## Domain of interest

### Why

We want to focus our project on the digital music field for three main reasons: first we are all users of music services such as Spotify, Itunes, Google Music and so on, second it grants many ways to explore it and eventually we share this passion also in our private life since many of us are musicians (or have been). We found really interesting have the opportunity to explore the data of this field and have the possibility to discover some fascinating information hide.

### Three data-driven project example

The first project found use the Spotify API in a really interesting way to predict the person's mood based on playlist composition, it shows good statistical skills but not too hard to handle, it could be an inspiration for our project.

This other project merges two different field: music and sport. This works by analyzing playlists that contain “Ajax” or “Ajax Amsterdam” in their name creates a subset of playlist (and song) related to the club, then it could be possible to go further and analyze the mood of club supporters!

The last project analyzed is an investigation of the insight of the Top100 artist in the US, the main target of this project is to use the data to label at the best the music with a category. In this way you can obtain information about what is the mainstream music of these nowdays.

### Data-driven questions

1. What features have TOP50 artists in Europe & China, some comparisons? We would like to generate a Map of nations (Europe) for the most common type of music (according to the features contained in the dataset).
2. What characterizes best a new viral song? Which features is the most important, what is its average lifespan? (We would like to focus on Italy first and then extend it to Europe). 
3. Which countries are listen their respective song instead of song from foreign country? 
4. Analysis on the evolution of the prefer music in the respective country?
